CLI Lab Repository 

This lab provides a hands-on demonstration of how a C program transitions from source code to a user-accessible CLI command. Additionally, it contrasts the platform-specific nature of compiled C programs with the platform-agnostic Python runtime.

Files:

- burger.c: C source code.
- python_burger.py: Python version of the program.
